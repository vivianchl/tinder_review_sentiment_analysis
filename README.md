# Tinder Review for Sentiment Analysis

## Stroy

Tinder has been a very popular dating app in Germany, but it has often received mixed reviews in the software market, and Tinder wanted a data scientist to analyze customer reviews to provide valuable insight into how the company could improve the user experience, increase the app's functionality, and remain competitive in the dating app market.

The data scientists decided to analyze the user reviews of Tinder in the app marketplace by first classifying the reviews using an NLP model. Analyzing the sentiment of app reviews can provide Tinder with an understanding of user satisfaction levels. Positive sentiment indicates happy and satisfied users, while negative sentiment may suggest issues or dissatisfaction. By addressing concerns raised in negative reviews, Tinder can work towards improving user satisfaction, which can lead to higher user retention rates.  

The goal is to perform Fine-tuning based on the pre-trained model of Hugging Face, the model should be able to predict if a review is positive or negative.
